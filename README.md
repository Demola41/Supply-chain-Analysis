## 1. Situation
Analyzed supply chain data for a **Fashion and Beauty startup** to evaluate the flow of products from suppliers to customers and identify bottlenecks.
## 2. Task
The goal was to optimize logistics by analyzing shipping carrier performance, cost distribution, and product defect rates across different transportation modes.
## 3. Action
Developed a dynamic **Excel Dashboard**, utilizing advanced Slicers for navigation and filtering.
* **KPI Visualization:** Visualized Key Metrics like **Total Revenue ($2.29M)** with Card visuals.
* **Granular Analysis:** Performed a deep dive into "Revenue by SKU" using interactive Pivot Charts.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Top Carrier:** **Carrier B** was identified as the top revenue generator (**$1.04M**) but was also the highest cost center.
* **Bottleneck:** **Road transport** was flagged as the slowest method, with the longest lead time averaging **17 days**.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Cost Negotiation:** Renegotiate contracts with **Carrier B** to lower shipping costs, using their volume dominance as leverage.
* **Speed Optimization:** Shift time-sensitive **Skincare products** away from Road transport to faster modes to improve delivery speeds and customer satisfaction.
